<h1><b>Which Databases Use SQL?</b></h1>
<p>SQL is just a query language. You typically use it to interact with a specific database technology. For example:
<ul>
<li>SQLite</li>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>CockroachDB</li>
<li>Oracle</li>
<li>etc...</li>
</p>
<p>Although many different databases use the SQL language, most of them will have their own dialect. It's critical to understand that not all databases are created equal. Just because one SQL-compatible database does things a certain way, doesn't mean every SQL-compatible database will follow those exact same patterns.</p>


<h3><b>Why We use SQLite</b></h3> 
<p>In this Journey, we'll be using SQLite specifically. SQLite is great for embedded projects, web browsers, and toy projects. It's lightweight, but has limited functionality compared to the likes of PostgreSQL or MySQL - two of the more common production SQL technologies.

We'll point out to you whenever some functionality we're working with is unique to SQLite!</p>
