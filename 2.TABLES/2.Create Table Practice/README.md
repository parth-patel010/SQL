# 🧪 Create Table Practice

In most **relational databases**, a single table isn't enough to hold all the data we need.

We usually follow the principle of **"one table per entity"**.

## 💬 Example: Social Media App Tables

For a basic social media application, you might create:

- 👤 `users` – stores user information  
- 📝 `posts` – stores the posts created by users  
- 💬 `comments` – stores comments on posts  
- ❤️ `likes` – stores which users liked which posts

### 💡 Why Multiple Tables?

- Keeps data **organized** by type
- Allows **relationships** (e.g. users have many posts)
- Prevents **data duplication**
- Enables **efficient queries** using JOINs
