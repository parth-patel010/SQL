# 🗄️ Comparing SQL Databases

Let’s dive deeper into some of the popular SQL databases and what makes each one unique.

## 🏆 Most Popular SQL Databases
- **PostgreSQL**
- **MySQL**
- **Microsoft SQL Server**
- **SQLite**
- …and many others

While all of these use SQL, each database defines its own rules, conventions, and optimizations.

## 🔍 SQLite vs. PostgreSQL

I personally favor **SQLite** and **PostgreSQL**:

- **PostgreSQL**  
  - Powerful, open-source, production-ready  
  - Uses a client–server model  
  - Requires a running server process listening on a network port

- **SQLite**  
  - Lightweight, serverless, embeddable  
  - No separate server required—runs directly within your application

## 🚀 We Use SQLite in This Course

In this course, we'll be using **SQLite**—a lightweight and easy-to-use SQL engine.

- Ideal for learning and small-scale apps  
- For larger production systems or full-featured back-end services, **PostgreSQL** or similar is a better production-ready choice
